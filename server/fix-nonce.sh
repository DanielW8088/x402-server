# Fix nonce issues - Clean stuck payments and restart services
# 
# This script fixes nonce synchronization issues by:
# 1. Stopping services to prevent new transactions
# 2. Cleaning stuck queue items (allows them to be reprocessed)
# 3. Rebuilding code with latest fixes
# 4. Restarting services (NonceManager will resync from chain)
